The intension behind this project is to create a general purpose foundation for this feature, with the scripts located in `./spatial_markers`. Specific implementations of this feature would extend these scripts, with examples of these in the `./demo` directory.

The project is still in it's early stages and is therefore unstable and subject to compatibility breaking changes.
